# Todo Application - Any Language

This project is a Todo application that can be implemented in any programming language. The application is designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing for implementation in various languages and frameworks.

## Structure

The application is divided into three main parts:

### Web API:

This is the backend of the application. It is responsible for handling requests from the frontend, processing them, and returning responses. It interacts with the database and performs operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) categories and tasks.

### NET Core

    1.1.1 - Todo API Basic
    1.1.2 - Todo API with Unit of Work and Repository Pattern
    1.1.3 - Todo API with CQRS and MediatR

#### 1.2 - Java Spring Boot

    1.2.1 - Todo API Basic

#### 1.3 - Node.js Express

    1.3.1 - Todo API Basic

#### 1.4 - Python Flask

    1.4.1 - Todo API Basic

#### 1.5 - Go Gin

    1.5.1 - Todo API Basic

### 2. Web MVC:

This is the server-side framework that handles the logic of the application. It interacts with the Web API to fetch data and render it to the frontend.

#### .NET Core MVC

```
Updating...
```

#### Java Spring MVC

```
Updating...
```

#### Node.js Express MVC

```
Updating...
```

#### Python Flask MVC

```
Updating...
```

#### Go Gin MVC

```
Updating...
```

### 3. Frontend:

This is the user interface of the application. It is built using frontend frameworks or libraries such as Angular, ReactJS, or VueJS. It sends requests to the Web API and displays the data received in a user-friendly manner.

#### Angular

```
Updating...
```

#### ReactJS

```
Updating...
```

#### VueJS

```
Updating...
```

## Features

- CRUD operations: Creating, reading, updating, and deleting categories and tasks.
- User authentication: <em>Updating...</em>
